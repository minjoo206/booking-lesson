# Stripe-Style Payment Pages - Complete Implementation

## ðŸŽ‰ Successfully Created!

I've created a payment interface that closely matches the Stripe Link checkout design you showed me. The implementation includes multiple versions to suit different use cases.

## ðŸ“± Available Payment Pages

### 1. **Demo/Selection Page** - `/payment`
- Landing page that showcases both payment options
- Clean interface to choose between integrated or standalone checkout
- Shows all available lesson packages
- **Access:** `http://localhost:3001/payment`

### 2. **Integrated Payment Page** - `/payment/integrated`
- Payment page with app navigation
- Perfect for authenticated users within the app flow
- Matches the Stripe Link design with product details on left, payment form on right
- **Access:** `http://localhost:3001/payment/integrated`

### 3. **Standalone Checkout** - `/checkout`
- Clean, distraction-free checkout experience
- No navigation - focused purely on conversion
- Ideal for direct payment links or embedded flows
- **Access:** `http://localhost:3001/checkout`
